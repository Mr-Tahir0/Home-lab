# ðŸ§ª Home Lab

Welcome to my **Home Lab** â€” a personal workspace for building, experimenting, and refining my software development and security skills.

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose
To create useful, meaningful, and sometimes experimental projects that help me grow as a developer and an analyst and demonstrate practical problem-solving ability.


## ðŸ“ˆ Goals
- Build 10+ original projects before the end of my roadmap.  
- Deploy 5 of them publicly (Vercel, Netlify, Render).  
- Document each project with a clear README, live demo, and GitHub link.
